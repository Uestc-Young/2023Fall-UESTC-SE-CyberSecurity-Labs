ðŸ’¡ For Study Purpose Only
- `Lab 01`   
1. Configure the TLS protocol analysis environment.  
2. Configure the HTTPS protocol for the Apache server.  
3. Initiate HTTPS requests for specified domain names, capture packets, analyze the TLS protocol process, and extract key information from it.
   
- `Lab 02`
1. Configure a wireless network attack environment, or alternatively, use the provided pcap file in the experiment.
2. Capture wireless network handshake packets.
3. Develop a program to crack the WPA-PSK passphrase, with no restrictions on programming language.

- `Lab 03` 
1. Develop a program to test shellcode. You can write your own shellcode or use msfvenom to generate shellcode. Consider testing multiple different shellcodes.
2. Elevate privileges through stack buffer overflow. Perform a stack buffer overflow attack on the given program to achieve privilege escalation.
3. Advanced stack buffer overflow privilege escalation. Modify data in the given program, perform another overflow attack, and consider executing other shellcode for increased complexity.

- `Lab 04`
1. Set up the Web attack and defense experimental environment using DVWA as the target machine.
2. Perform command injection, SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks on the target machine, with security levels primarily focusing on Low level and Medium level.
